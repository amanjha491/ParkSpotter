# ParkSpotter
The project focuses on automating parking spot detection by employing image processing techniques. It involves segmenting parking slots from images, converting them into binary image, and subsequently analysing them against a predefined threshold value. This analysis determines the presence or absence of vehicles within the parking spots.
